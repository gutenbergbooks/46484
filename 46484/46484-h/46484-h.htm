<h2 class="no-break">Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a very wonderful thing, when we stop
to think of it, that no matter where we are
placed in this great round world of ours, it
seems just right to us.</p>

<p>Far away in the frozen north, where the
lovely aurora borealis dances in the sky, where
the long sunless winter night stretches halfway
across the year, live a people who cannot
keep themselves alive without working very
hard. Yet they are happy and fun-loving.
They <i>make</i> pleasures for themselves. They
are patient and joyous in the midst of darkness
and storm. They do not think of complaining
at their hard lot, or that they do not live
where Nature is kinder and more generous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>We call them Eskimos. They belong to
another race than ours,&mdash;a different branch
of the great human family. They are yellow
and we are white, to be sure. But we know
that, no matter how far away any race of people
lives, and no matter how different these
people may be from us in looks and habits,
they and we belong to the same great family.
It includes every race and every colour, for we
are the children of one Father.</p>

<p>What a pleasure it is, therefore, to travel
from place to place and see more of the life
of others! But suppose we cannot journey
with our bodies; we need not stay at home
on that account. Let us use the wings of the
mind, and without trouble or expense visit
the hot lands and the cold, the yellow children
and the red. Let us know them and learn
what they can teach us.</p>

<small>BABY DAYS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A pair</span> of very bright black eyes peered out
from the mother's hood that winter morning.
The thermometer, if there had been one, would
have shown the temperature to be seventy
degrees below the freezing point.</p>

<p>Yet baby Etu did not seem to care. He
was nestled so warmly in the heavy furs, and
felt so safe on his mother's broad back, that
he laughed and crowed in pure delight.</p>

<p>It was his first ride since he was born, and
there was so much to look at! At least he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
thought so, though great sheets of snow
stretched outward to the frozen ocean, and
covered the land in every direction. The
twinkling stars gave the only light for Etu
to see by, yet it was daytime. It was that
part of the twenty-four hours when the baby's
people did their work; and that must be
called day in Etu's far northern country, even
though darkness covers all the land.</p>

<p>For Etu lives in the frozen zone, on the
shores of northern Alaska, and during the
long winter of eight months the sun shows
his face very little above the horizon.</p>

<p>Here and there the snow looked as if it
had been raised into low mounds. Near
these mounds holes could be seen in the
ground, and pathways dug out between them.
There were no trees, no fences, no roads.</p>

<p>Where was the village, and where was the
baby's home? Those holes marked the entrances
to the winter houses built by Etu's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
father and his neighbours. The mounds were
the coverings of the houses. Great pits had
been dug in the earth, and lined with driftwood
which had floated on to the shore.
Jaws of whales made the framework of the
roofs, these being covered with sods cut out
of the marshy plains in summer. Mother
Nature did the rest by protecting all with a
warm close blanket of snow.</p>

<p>At first it makes one shudder to think of
living in such homes during the long Arctic
winter. But the Eskimos are satisfied, and
feel so comfortable that they remove a great
part of their clothing while they are indoors.
The houses are made so snug that the sharpest
winds cannot enter, and they cost nothing
but the labour of making them.</p>

<p>Etu's mother allowed him to stay out only
a few minutes this first time. She soon turned
toward home, and coming to her own doorway
crawled down through a long slanting tunnel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
in the ground, eight or ten feet long. When
she reached the end, she was obliged to stoop
even lower, for now she must pass upwards
through another passage. Lifting a trap-door,
she stepped at once into the middle of her
own home.</p>

<p>Why was there such a queer entrance? Because
the wind must be kept out at all hazards.
After all, it seemed easy and natural
enough to this woman who had never known
other and pleasanter hallways.</p>

<p>How close it seemed after the fresh cold air
outdoors! There was a strong odour of smoking
oil. It was noisy, too, as other women
and children were moving around inside, for
the house was shared in common by several
families who were friendly to each other, and
enjoyed living together.</p>

<p>Etu's mother quickly took off her outer
coat of sealskin, and, lifting her baby out of
his warm nest, placed him on a platform which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
stretched along one side of the room. What
a round, smiling dumpling he was! His face
was broad and flat, while his little nose looked
as though it had been punched inwards. His
bright eyes were quite narrow.</p>

<p>He wore a curious skin cap drawn tightly
over the top of his head. He must keep
this on night and day for a year, at least.
It would make his forehead taper upward,
and that is a mark of beauty among his
people. As soon as he was born, the top
of his head was pressed between his nurse's
hands, and the cap fitted on at once so that
his head might grow in the proper shape.
After that operation he was taken outdoors,
and rolled in the snow. I suppose that was
to get him used to the cold climate of his
birthplace. Don't you?</p>

<p>Baby Etu's skin was much whiter than his
mother's,&mdash;very nearly as white, in fact, as
your own little brother's. Why has he changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
so much since he has grown to be a big boy?
Listen to the strange reason.</p>

<p>When our Eskimo cousin was born, there
was a small dark spot on his back. Day by
day it grew larger; the change came very
slowly, so slowly it could scarcely be noticed.
But at last the darker colour had spread over
the boy's whole body, till his skin was nearly
like that of his father and mother.</p>

<p>In course of time it would grow darker still,
because he did not wash himself. Please don't
be shocked. It is <i>so</i> hard to get water in that
frozen land. Snow must first be melted, and
to do this heat is required. Heating requires
the burning of oil, and oil is very precious.
It is scarcely any wonder, therefore, that Etu
has not been taught to be cleanly in all ways.</p>

<p>The smoky air of the home during the long
winter months also made the boy's skin grow
darker. Sometimes during his babyhood his
mother would wash him as a mother cat washes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
her kittens, but that was all he has ever known
of the delights of a bath. The mother-love
made that pleasant, perhaps, but we cannot
envy him.</p>

<p>It was quite surprising to an Arctic explorer
some years ago, when he discovered the difference
soap and warm water would make in an
Eskimo's appearance.</p>

<p>"Why, you are almost a white man," he
exclaimed, "your friends will think you have
been changed into another being by some
magical spell." And he laughed heartily when
he thought of the only magic being soap and
water.</p>

<p>Etu tumbled about on the sealskins which
covered the platform, watching his mother
while she trimmed the wick of the lamp.
What an odd-looking lamp it was! It was
made of a crescent-shaped stone hollowed out.
Think of the labour of making it! It must
have taken days, and even weeks, before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
cavity was hollowed enough to hold the oil.
But Etu's people are such patient workers
they do not worry over the time they spend.</p>

<p>Moss was built up around the sides of the
lamp; it served for the wick which spluttered
away as the oil burned and warmed the room.
A lump of seal fat, or blubber as it is called,
hung over the lamp. As it melted slowly in
the heat, it dripped down into the cavity and
furnished a steady supply of oil.</p>

<p>There were two other lamps burning in
Etu's home, for you must remember there was
a very large family living here. And these
queer lamps not only gave light and warmth
to all these people, but the cooking must also
be done over them.</p>

<p>Etu watched the light with blinking eyes
for a few moments, and then fell fast asleep.
Only think of it, he was nearly naked! There
was no covering on his tiny body except
a short skirt of fur,&mdash;his arms and legs were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
quite bare, yet his loving mother did not hurry
to cover him over. He must get used to cold
while he was still small, so that when he grew
older he could bear exposure better.</p>

<small>MOTHER AND CHILD.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> mother was proud that this first baby
was a boy. She liked to dream of what a
great hunter he would become. In a few years
he would do his part to keep the wolf from
the door, in more senses than one. He would
bring home the seal, the walrus, now growing
so scarce, the grim white bear, and make many
a feast for his people. Oh, no, girls could
never do such things as these! She was a
happy woman, indeed.</p>

<p>This Eskimo mother had a pleasant, sunny
face, even though the chin was tattooed with
three long lines from the mouth downwards.
She firmly believed that it would be looked
upon as a sign of goodness, when she reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the next world. It might help in bringing her
to heaven.</p>

<p>The work was done by her own hands and
must have been quite painful. The sinew of a
reindeer furnished the thread which she blackened
with soot. Fastening it in her bone
needle, she drew it under and through the skin
till the lines were plainly marked. They would
stay that way as long as she lived.</p>

<p>She bustled about at her work without fuss
or hurry. More than once the children playing
in the room got in her way, but she did
not scold nor even look cross. Now and then
a hungry-looking dog poked his head up
through the doorway, only to be chased out
of sight again when discovered. As she
worked she joined in the laughter and talk
of the women.</p>

<p>Hark! the sound of many feet could be
heard, and the women and children stopped
their chatter to welcome the men of the household,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
who had been away on a bear hunt for
many hours.</p>

<p>"What luck? What luck?" all said at
once, but there was no story of brave fighting
to tell this night; the long march over
the icy plains had met with no reward. But
there was no danger of starving at present,
for great dishes of smoking seal soup stood
ready for the hunters.</p>

<p>In a few minutes all the household were
squatting on the floor around the bowls.
They ate the delicious supper to their hearts'
content; and how they did eat! It seemed
as though their stomachs must be made of
elastic, for otherwise how were they able to
stow away such immense quantities of the
rich, fatty food?</p>

<p>With Etu's people it is either a feast or
a famine all the time. They have no regular
time to eat, no such thing as breakfast, dinner,
and supper. If there is a good supply of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
food on hand, they will keep on eating hour
after hour in a way to fill other people with
wonder. But if there is nothing in the larder
they are able to go several days without
eating; yet they seem to keep well and
strong.</p>

<p>All were satisfied at last, and baby Etu
waked up in time to be held and petted for
a while before bedtime.</p>

<p>His mother did not have any dishes to
wash, but before she could settle herself for
the night she had to arrange a net over the
seal-oil lamp, and spread her husband's wet
clothing in it to dry. She must rouse herself
during the night to watch and turn it from
time to time, for that is a woman's work, she
has been taught.</p>

<p>But where were all these people going to
stow themselves for sleeping? There was no
sign of a bed in the whole house. That question
was easily settled, for a portion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
platform was set aside for each family. They
arranged their fur rugs upon it, and crept in
side by side. Then, taking off all their clothing,
they buried themselves under the warm
covers. First in order lay the father of a
family, next came the mother, and close to her
the youngest child was always nestled.</p>

<p>Baby Etu slept, warm and safe, that night
and many afterward. Not once during the
long winter did he cry from colic.</p>

<p>As soon as he was able to sit up alone
his mother gave him lessons in what he
needed most,&mdash;strength of body, and ease
in moving every muscle. She would sit on
the floor or platform and stretch out her legs
in front of her. Then she would brace Etu
against her feet, and, holding his hands, would
bend his arms in every possible direction.
Now they must be stretched upwards, now
to the right, the left, behind him, and so on.
This would make him agile in hunting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the baby could walk he began
to have other exercises for his legs, for he
must make a good runner and dancer, also.</p>

<p>As soon as Etu began to take more notice
of those around him, he received many presents
of toys. There were animals carved out
of ivory,&mdash;tiny whales and walruses, baby
seals and reindeer. He could not break them
easily. They were fine things to press against
his aching gums when the first teeth pushed
themselves into sight. If he had been a girl
he would have had an ivory doll, with a little
dress of mouse skin, but, of course, a boy
would not care for such a plaything. It was
not to be thought of.</p>

<p>Soon the time came for his first suit of
clothes, and, oh, how many days of patient
work his mamma spent on those little garments!</p>

<p>In the first place, there must be some long
stockings of reindeer skin, so made that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
hairy side lay next his body. After that came
socks of the skin taken from eider-ducks.
And outside of all he must wear stout boots
of sealskin with soles of thick whale hide. He
must draw these up to his hips over his two
pairs of deerskin trousers, just as his father
and mother themselves did. His jacket was
made of reindeer skin, with a warm hood
fastened to it to draw over his head while
outdoors in the searching winds. It had no
buttons either before or behind, but fitted
quite loosely.</p>

<p>Some one asks: "How did he get into this
garment, since there were no openings except
for the neck and sleeves?" He slipped it
down over his head, as American boys put
on their jerseys. The skin had been tanned
and stretched and softened so beautifully by
his mother that it was quite easy to do this.</p>

<p>The baby's jacket was shaped round exactly
like his father's, while his mother's had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
a long pointed tail both in front and behind.
Besides this difference, her own jacket is always
trimmed with a fringe of coloured beads
bought of the traders. This fringe reaches
around the neck, and also around both of the
tails. It is very beautiful, her neighbours all
declare.</p>

<p>It seems quite wonderful to us that Etu's
boots could be perfectly water-tight, although
they were home-made. This Eskimo mother
is such a fine seamstress with her coarse needle
and thread, that a drop of water cannot enter
the skin boots after her work is done.</p>

<p>When his first suit was entirely finished,
and Etu was dressed, he was ready for the
coldest weather. As soon as he could walk
easily, he had no more need to ride in the
warm hood on his mother's back. There
were times before this, however, when he cried
with the cold even in that snug place, and his
mother had been obliged to stop in her walk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
loosen her jacket, and slip the baby inside of
all her clothing next to her own warm body.
After that the crying would stop, and Etu
would coo softly as the two went on their
way.</p>

<p>How many things had to be done before
the baby's suit was finished! In the first
place, his papa must kill the animals which
furnished the warm skins. But when that was
done, <i>his</i> work was over. It was his wife's
turn now. She removed the skins from the
dead reindeer and seal, and stretched them out
to dry, with the hairy side toward the earth.</p>

<p>After a few days they were ready for her to
begin the hardest part of the task. They
must be scraped with a sharp knife until every
atom of flesh should be removed, as well as
the inner tough skin. Now they were flexible
enough for all the clothing except the stockings,
and these must be very soft indeed for
the tender baby feet. A piece of the skin of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
baby deer was chosen by the careful mother,
who next proceeded to chew it, inch by inch.
Her teeth were beautifully white and sharp,
but the work was done so carefully that no
hole, nor even mark, could be seen in the skin
when it was finished.</p>

<p>She was ready now to cut out the various
garments with her odd scissors,&mdash;but, after
all, it is wrong to call the queer knife she
uses by the name of scissors. She speaks of
it as an "oodlo," and it is useful in so many
ways, she really could not keep house without
it. It is shaped much like your mother's
meat-chopper. It is made of bone edged with
iron, and when Etu's mother cuts with it, she
moves it away from her in a way which looks
very awkward to us. It not only takes the
place of scissors, but is the hatchet, the knife,
and also scraper with which the flesh is removed
from the skins.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>PLAY-DAYS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Month</span> after month passed by with baby
Etu. The little round ball grew into a sturdy
boy, who delighted in rough plays outdoors, as
well as many indoor games, when the storms
raged too greatly for him to leave the house.</p>

<p>His mother never refused him anything
possible to get. He was never scolded or
punished, so it is no wonder he grew up kind
and honest and truthful. And laugh? Why,
you can't imagine how many things there are
for Eskimo children to laugh about. In that
cold and dreary land one would expect to see
long faces, and hear people constantly groaning
and complaining; but, instead of that,
these people of the far north may be said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
be ever "on the grin," as travellers there have
often expressed it.</p>

<p>And Etu was like the rest of his people.
He was always finding some new source of
fun and pleasure. When he was still a tiny
baby, left to amuse himself on the platform
inside the house, he would watch for the dogs
to appear in the passageway, and throw his
ivory toys at them. Then he would laugh
and shake his sides as they dodged the play-things
and scampered away.</p>

<p>Sometimes one of the older children would
bring him a ball of snow or ice and teach him
to kick it into the air again and again, without
touching it with his hands, yet keeping it in
motion all the time.</p>

<p>When he grew older and braver he allowed
himself to be tossed up in the air in a blanket
of walrus hide. He must keep on his feet
all the time, and not tumble about in the
blanket. After awhile he could go almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to the roof and back again, holding himself
as straight as a little soldier.</p>

<p>Of course he slid down-hill and had any
amount of sport, but the sled was generally
the seat of his own deerskin trousers. He
and his playmates liked to start from the top
of an icy hill, and vie with each other in
reaching the foot.</p>

<p>Sometimes the little fellows would double
themselves up so they looked like balls of fur,
then down the hill they would roll, over and
over, one after another. And when they reached
the bottom and jumped upon their feet, what a
shouting there would be as they shook themselves
and brushed off the snow!</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 342px;">
<img src="images/i035.jpg" width="342" height="500" alt="boy riding slab shooting bow and arrow" />
<div class="caption">"HE WHO HITS THE GREATEST NUMBER WINS THE GAME"</div>
</div>

<p>Now that Etu is a big boy, he plays still
another game on the snowy hillsides. His
father has killed a great number of reindeer,
and the boy is allowed to have all the antlers
he wishes. When the boys want to play the
reindeer game, as we may call it, they set up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the antlers in the snow, a short distance apart
from each other. Then they climb the hill
again, and, seating themselves on their sleds,
slide down past the antlers. They must steer
clear of them and reach the foot without running
into a single one. At least, that is the
game, and the ones who do so successfully are
the winners.</p>

<p>But what kind of a sled do you think Etu
uses? It is simply a cake of ice; if you stop
to think a moment, you can imagine how
swiftly and smoothly it travels along.</p>

<p>There is a still different game of reindeer-hunting
which requires more skill.</p>

<p>This time Etu and his playfellows arm themselves
with bows and arrows. As they coast
rapidly past the reindeer antlers, they shoot at
them and try to leave their arrows fixed in as
many as possible. Of course, he who hits the
greatest number wins the game. This is exciting
sport indeed, and Etu will go home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
afterward ready to eat such a quantity of
frozen seal blubber as to make the eyes
of any one but an Eskimo open wide with
wonder.</p>

<p>Eskimo, I just said; but Etu does not call
himself by that name. He will tell you that
he is one of the Innuits, as his father has
taught him. The word "Innuit" means
"people."</p>

<p>Etu's mother has told him of an old, old
legend of her race, about the creation of the
world. At first human beings were made
white, but they were not worthy of their
Maker. Then others were created who were
the true people, or the Innuits.</p>

<p>The word Eskimo means "eater of raw fish."
It was given to these natives of the far north
by the travellers who came among them and
observed their queer ways of living and eating.</p>

<p>"Raw meat! Raw fish!" they exclaimed
among themselves. "These are indeed queer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
people who enjoy such food in a freezing
climate."</p>

<p>So it came about that they spoke of them
as Eskimos, and the name has clung to Etu's
people ever since.</p>

<p>The boy remembers well his first candy.
He had been ill, but was getting strong once
more. His good patient mother wished to
bring a smile to his pale face, so while he was
sleeping she prepared a surprise.</p>

<p>She took the red feet of a bird called the
dovekie, and, drawing out the bones, blew into
the skin until it was puffed out as full as possible.
Then she poured melted reindeer fat
into these bright-colored pouches, and the
candy-bags were finished.</p>

<p>Etu's eyes grew suddenly bright when they
opened upon the surprise prepared for him.
It did not take many minutes, you may well
believe, for every bit of this odd candy to disappear.
You may like chocolate creams and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
cocoanut cakes, and think them the greatest
treat in the world, but in Etu's opinion there
is nothing better than a big lump of seal blubber
or the marrow from the inside of a deer's
bones.</p>

<p>When he had his first bow and arrow, it
was a very tiny one. He learned to shoot at
a target inside his winter home. His mother
would hang up pieces of fat meat across the
room where he sat, and he would try very
hard to pierce them. If he succeeded, he
could have the meat to eat, so of course he
tried very hard.</p>

<p>At other times he would sit watching for a
dog to push his head up through the doorway,
and let fly the arrow at him. At first this
seems like a very cruel sport, but the arrow
was blunted and very small; it could not do
much harm, even if it struck the dog, who
would bound away out of sight only to appear
again in a few moments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, Etu has played ball all his life,
but his ball is of a different kind from yours.
It is made of sealskin. Sometimes he will try
with other boys to knock it about so continually
that it is kept in the air for a long, long
time without falling. At other times all engage
in a grand game of football, but, according
to their ideas, the children must on no
account touch the ball with their hands.
That would be a "foul play," as you boys
would say. By their rules it can only be
kicked.</p>

<p>In the long winter evenings there is still
more fun. In Etu's big household old and
young gather around the dim, smoky lamp
and tell stories. There are such wonderful
adventures to relate of daring deeds on sea
and land. Etu listens breathless to tales of
the white bear surprised in his den, of long
tramps after prey, when life depended on
fresh supplies, and King Frost was striving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to seize the weakened bodies of the
hunters.</p>

<p>Then there are quaint legends and fairy
tales, besides stories of wondrous beings in
the unseen world around. Some of these
beings are good, and some bad. Etu does
not like to hear about these last, and tries
to put them out of his mind when he is
travelling alone.</p>

<p>But the evenings are not wholly given to
story-telling, for the people are fond of music.
They like dancing, also, for it makes them
feel jolly and gay. They pass many an
hour singing monotonous songs which they
think very sweet, but which we would think
tiresome.</p>

<p>Sometimes when Etu's mother has finished
her work for the day, she gathers the children
of the house around her, and shows them how
to make wonderful figures with strings of
deer's sinews. You all know the game of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
cat's cradle; well, it is something like that,
only very much harder.</p>

<p>The woman fastens the string back and
forth on her son's hands, then weaves it
quickly in and out; before one knows it,
she has shaped it into the body of a musk
ox. A few more changes are made, when,
behold! it is no longer a musk ox, but has
become a reindeer or a seal. It requires a
great deal of skill to do this, but Etu can
make nearly as many figures as his mother,
although she has had so many years of
practice.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>DOG TEAM AND SLEDGE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> he was three years old, our little
northern cousin had his first and only pets.
They were two little puppies left without any
mother. They looked like baby wolves with
their sharp, pointed noses, erect ears, and
furry backs; but they were very cunning, and
amused their little master all day long. When
night came they crept under the heavy covers,
and lay close to Etu's feet while he slept,
keeping him as warm and comfortable as he
could possibly desire to be.</p>

<p>But, like all other pets, these puppies <i>would</i>
grow up, and then their work in life began as
well as Etu's. They must be trained to draw
a sledge, for they must be able to carry their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
young master on long journeys over the snowy
plains.</p>

<p>Etu's mother made him some reins to be
fastened to the dogs' necks. She placed the
ends in the hands of her little boy, who sat on
the platform, holding a whip. He must learn
to manage the team, he must teach the dogs
to obey his voice, to move to the right or the
left, as he directed; in short, to understand
that he was truly their master.</p>

<p>Every new birthday two more dogs were
given to Etu, and it became his duty to feed
and train them to be in readiness when he
was old enough to hunt with his father.</p>

<p>Do not imagine for a moment that this was
an easy matter. No white man has ever yet,
I believe, found himself able to manage a
pack of Eskimo dogs. Each one is fastened
to the sledge by a single cord, and, as they
hurry onward at the sound of their master's
voice, it seems as though there were the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
dreadful confusion. One dog, wiser and cleverer
than the rest, is always chosen as the
leader; his rein is a little longer than the
others. He is always the one that listens
most closely to the directions given, turning
his head backward from time to time to look
at his master, and make sure that he is right.
Then onward he dashes, the other dogs following
close at his heels.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/i047.jpg" width="351" height="500" alt="boy riding dogslep with dogs seeming to run in all directions" />
<div class="caption">"ETU HAD BECOME QUITE SKILFUL"</div>
</div>

<p>Etu spent some time in deciding which dog
was the best out of his own pack, but when
he was quite sure of Vanya's strength and
brightness he gave him the greatest care and
attention of all.</p>

<p>But the whip! It was far harder to learn
its use than to master all his other lessons.
The handle was only six inches long, while the
lash was at least sixteen feet. To throw it out
and then bring it back without letting it become
entangled among the legs of two or
three dogs was a difficult task. But to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
sure of striking only the one for whom it was
intended, was a far harder thing to learn.
Even when Etu had become quite skilful, it
seemed as though every time he rode away he
must come home with at least one broken
bone. For as the dogs gradually gained in
speed, and one or another received a stroke of
the whip to remind him of his duty, he would
jump wildly around. Perhaps he would upset
two or three others in an instant. Then there
would be such a yelping, and such a breaking
of reins would follow, it seemed impossible for
Etu to straighten them out again, and harder
still it must have been for him to keep his
seat, and not be thrown off.</p>

<p>But the boy loves the work, and nothing
pleases him more than to be sent twenty miles
to a neighbouring village on an errand for his
father.</p>

<p>In the winter season, when the dogs are not
working, they are sometimes allowed to stay in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the passageway leading to the house. And
you already know that they try again and
again to make their way inside. The burning
lamp gives such pleasant warmth, and the
smell of the seal or reindeer meat is so tempting
that they are willing to run the chance of
the blows they are almost sure to get for being
so daring.</p>

<p>They are warmly clothed, however, and can
bear the most terrible weather without harm
coming to them. Beneath the long hair a
heavy soft wool grows in the winter time, and
protects their bodies from the icy cold.</p>

<p>It is Etu's duty to feed all the dogs of the
household. It does not take a great amount
of his time, for the poor hard-working creatures
have only one meal in two days! If
there is danger of a famine, and provisions are
scarce, they are fed but once in three days.
This is during the winter, moreover, for in
summer they are expected to provide for themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
getting fish from the shallow beds of
the rivers, killing birds as they alight on the
shore, catching baby seals, and getting reindeer
moss or lichens from the rocks.</p>

<p>It is fun to watch Etu on feeding day. He
gathers the dogs around him in a wide circle,
and tosses first to one, then to another, his
strip of sealskin. If a dog moves from his
place or jumps out of turn to receive his food,
he is only rewarded by a lash of the whip,
instead of the longed-for meat. So by long
experience they have learned to wait patiently.</p>

<p>These Eskimo dogs must have wonderful
stomachs to digest the tough food on which
they live. It is simply impossible to chew the
strips of skin, so they are swallowed whole.
Sometimes a young dog chokes over his hard
work, and coughs up his precious bit, only to
have it snatched away from him by one of his
neighbours.</p>

<p>We feel like pitying these dogs of the cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
lands. They are deeply devoted to their
masters, yet a word of kindness is rarely
spoken to them. Their work is hard, and
their food is scant. In winter they must draw
the sledges, and in summer, as their masters
travel from place to place, they are laden with
heavy packs which they carry cheerfully.</p>

<p>This reminds me that when Etu played
"horse" in his early days, it wasn't <i>horse</i>,
after all; it was <i>dog</i>, instead, for the Eskimo
dog is the only horse of the far north.</p>

<p>When Etu was old enough to drive a team
of a dozen dogs, he had reached his tenth
birthday. His father said to him then:</p>

<p>"Now, Etu, you are old enough to make
your own sledge. You have often helped
me, but now you are able to do the work
alone."</p>

<p>Our little cousin set manfully to work at
once. It was so nice to think of having a
sledge for his very own, and one that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
made himself, too. It was not a very hard
task, once he had gathered his materials together.
The jawbones of a whale were used
for the framework and runners. Sealskin was
fitted over this framework, and a little seat
made from which Etu's legs hung over in
front when he was driving.</p>

<p>"But will the bone runners travel swiftly
enough over the snow?" some one asks.</p>

<p>"Not unless they are properly iced," Etu
would answer.</p>

<p>Every time the boy starts out on a journey,
he must prepare the runners afresh by squirting
water upon them from his mouth. A
coating of smooth ice is formed almost instantly,
which will last for a short distance.
Then it must be renewed.</p>

<p>Soon after Etu's sledge was completed, he
was sent by his father to look for seal-holes
along the coast. It was a bright, clear day,
and, although it was fifty degrees below zero,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the boy enjoyed his ride; he had no thought
of cold, as there was only a slight wind
blowing.</p>

<p>He journeyed on and on, his bright eyes
watching for signs of seals beneath the snow-covered
ice. He did not realise how far
he was from home. He was many miles
away, when a strong wind suddenly arose.
How it cut his cheeks and bit his nose! He
knew he must turn back at once or he might
be overcome.</p>

<p>Brave boy as he was, there would keep
entering his mind the thought of a neighbour
who was frozen while travelling in just such
weather. When his sledge arrived at his own
doorway, there sat the man in his seat, straight
and stiff; but the reins were tightly held in
dead hands. The dogs had kept on their way
unharmed, while the driver gradually lost all
knowledge of them, and of this world.</p>

<p>Etu put his gloved hand to his nose again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and again, to make sure it was all right; it
was such an easy thing for it to freeze without
his knowledge. And now his hands began to
grow numb, and then his feet, although he
often sprang from his sledge to run with the
dogs and jump in the snow.</p>

<p>Ah, that icy wind! Would it never stop?
The boy's eyes became blinded, and at last he
thought:</p>

<p>"It is of no use. I don't care very much,
anyway. I begin to feel so queer and stupid.
What does it mean?"</p>

<p>That was the last he knew till he awoke in
his own home to find his mother bending over
him; she was rubbing him with balls of snow,
and looking very, very anxious. How the
blood tingled through his body, as it began
to move freely once more! But he was safe
now, and could no longer feel the terrible
wind blowing against him.</p>

<p>It was a narrow escape for Etu. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
well for him that he was within a mile of the
village when he lost the power to think. The
dogs kept on their way, and brought him
quickly to his own home.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>KAYAK AND HARPOON.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Etu was only nine years old he
began to go out upon the ocean, fishing and
shooting with his father. Of course he was
allowed to go on calm days only. Years of
practice would be needed before he could be
trusted to manage his boat in winter storms,
or risk his life in seal hunting. When he was
eleven years old, however, he had learned to
paddle very well, and, besides, he had grown
to be such a big boy that his father said:</p>

<p>"You must have a new kayak, Etu; your
mother will help you make it. You have
outgrown the other, and it is not safe."</p>

<p>It was one of Etu's duties to watch for
all the driftwood floating in toward shore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Every piece is more precious to these people
of the north than we can imagine. They have
no money, but if they could express the value
of the bits of driftwood in dollars and cents,
we would be amazed. Some of us, I fear,
would feel like carrying a shipload of lumber
to Etu's people and making a fortune very
easily.</p>

<p>When our little Eskimo wished to begin
the making of his boat, he went first to the
family treasure house. Of course you can
guess what was stored there. Not diamonds
and pearls, nor gold and silver; but simply&mdash;driftwood.</p>

<p>Etu chose with much care the pieces from
which to make a stout framework for his
boat. It was important that he should take
light wood that had not lost its strength by
drifting about in the water too long. He
cut the strips with a bone knife and bound
them into shape with strong cords of seal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
sinew. The ends of the boat were sharply
pointed.</p>

<p>His mother's work began now. She took
the skins of seals which her husband had just
killed and scraped away all the scraps of blubber
and flesh left on the hides. Then, rolling
them tightly together, she left them for some
days. When they were again unrolled, it was
quite easy to scrape off the hairs with a mussel
shell. After this, the skins were well washed
in sea water.</p>

<p>A very important step must be taken next.
The skins must be stretched. Etu's first boat
must be a fine one and there must be no
wrinkles in the covering. The safest way was
to stretch them over the framework of the
boat itself. Then they would be sure to fit
well. An Eskimo woman feels very much
ashamed if any part of the boat's covering is
loose or wrinkled. People will think she is a
poor worker, and that would be a sad disgrace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>How did Etu's mother manage to make the
boat water-tight? It was done through her
careful sewing. She worked with her coarse
bone needle, and the sinews of seal and deer
were the only thread; yet when the kayak
was finished, not a single drop of water could
enter. It was a clever piece of work.</p>

<p>Where was Etu to sit in this wonderful
boat? The deck was entirely covered excepting
the small hole in the centre. The boy
had measured this hole with great care when he
made the framework of the kayak. It was
just large enough for him to squeeze through.
His feet and legs must be underneath the
deck, and his thighs should fill up the hole
exactly. Now you understand why the boy's
father spoke of his outgrowing the old boat.</p>

<p>Do you also see why there was no larger
hole? Think for a moment of the waters
through which he must ride. Our rough seas
would seem calm to Etu. If the deck were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
not covered, the dashing waves would swamp
his boat almost instantly. His people had
found this out for themselves; so they cleverly
planned a boat different from that of any other
in the world.</p>

<p>Etu made a stout paddle with two blades.
It is a pleasure for his mother and her friends
to watch him use it. He is very skilful, and
now, at twelve years of age, he can make the
kayak skim over the water like the wind. How
straight he always sits! He balances the boat
exactly and first bends the right blade into the
water, then the left, without seeming to work
hard, either. And in some wonderful way,
one can hardly understand how, he speeds
onward. No wonder it is such a pleasure to
watch him.</p>

<p>Etu is very proud of his paddle; not because
he made it, but because of the time his
mother spent in decorating it. It is inlaid
with bits of stone and ivory set in a pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
pattern. Surely, his mother is a fine worker.
She has just made him a present of a new
pair of gloves. They are to be worn while he
is out in his boat, and reach above his elbows.
They will protect his arms and keep them
dry, even if the waves sweep clear over
him. But they are not like common gloves,
for they are embroidered in a fine pattern.
She cut out bits of hide and dyed them
different colours. Then she sewed them
together in a neat design on the arm pieces
of the gloves. Shouldn't you call that embroidery?</p>

<p>While Etu's boat was being made, his
mother had a party. Perhaps it would be
better to call it a "sewing-bee." Etu was
sent around to the different women in the
village. He told them his mother was ready
to sew the covering on his boat. Would they
like to help her?</p>

<p>Now there is nothing Eskimo women like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
better than to come together for a friendly
chat. So the invitation was accepted, and
one morning, bright and early, a party of
women could be seen gathered around the
sealskins. Their fingers worked swiftly, but
I fear their tongues moved still faster. There
was a great deal of laughter, for they seemed
to have many funny stories to tell. And I
don't believe there was a bit of unkind gossip;
at least, their faces didn't show it.</p>

<p>It was amusing to see how much their teeth
were used. They were like another hand to
these Eskimo women, for, as they sewed, they
held the piece of skin in its place with their
teeth. When the covering must be stretched
over this hard place or that edge, it was the
teeth again that gave the needed help. Etu
knows one old woman whose teeth are worn
almost down to the gums. She must have
worked very hard all the years of her life.
She must have sewed on many boat-coverings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and made many suits of clothes before this
could have been done.</p>

<p>When Etu's kayak was finished, his mother
invited the workers up to the house, where
they were treated to a dish of seal-blood soup
and a pipe of tobacco. It was a grand surprise.
In the first place, the heated blood of
the seal is always a dainty; and then, they seldom
had the privilege of smoking tobacco. It
was a great rarity, for it could only be obtained
through trade with the white people.</p>

<p>When night came, all were in great good
humour as they left for their own homes.
But, as they stepped outdoors, what a beautiful
sight met their eyes! The northern lights
were shooting across the heavens in glorious
colours. Have you never noticed on cold
winter nights lines of light shooting upward
into the sky? It is always in the north that
we see them, and we wonder and exclaim as
we look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Your mother tells you, "It is the <i>Aurora
Borealis</i>." It is not fully known what causes
the strange light. It is thought, however, to
be electricity.</p>

<p>In Etu's land the aurora is far more wonderful
and beautiful than with us. The visitors
were used to such sights, yet they called
to the boy and his mother to come outdoors
and look.</p>

<p>"The lights are brighter than I ever saw
them in my life," exclaimed one of the women.
At first it seemed as though there were a great
cloud of light just above the horizon, but it
suddenly changed till the heavens appeared to
be alive. The very air around the people
quivered, as long, bright lines shot upward
across the sky. They changed so quickly,
it seemed as though a mighty power was
directing them about, now here, now there.
It made one dizzy to watch them. Now
there would be streamers of green and red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and blue darting from the sky-line way to
the very zenith. There they would meet in a
purplish crown of glory.</p>

<p>Again the sky would change in its appearance,
and a red light would spread over all.
It was so bright that the snow in every direction
was tinted a rosy colour.</p>

<p>"What makes it, mother?" whispered Etu.
"Is it the work of good spirits, or are evil
ones trying to show us their power?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, my child," was the
answer. "We are not wise, and cannot understand
these things. Come, let us go back
into the house. The sight makes me fearful."</p>

<p>Etu had many finishing touches to put on
his boat after it was covered. A wooden hoop
must be fitted around the hole in which he
was to sit. Several thongs of seal hide must
be fastened on the deck, under which his spear
and harpoon should rest while he paddled.
Still other straps were bound to the sides of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the deck, for, unless the birds or seals could
be fastened to the boat in some way after they
had been killed, how could they be towed
home?</p>

<p>Then Etu began to work on his harpoon.
His father had to help him now, for it needed
skill and care to fit it exactly to the throwing-stick.
The Eskimos long ago found that the
bow and arrow were not useful in their narrow,
dangerous boats. Only a one-handed weapon
can be used in such a place, so they invented
the harpoon and the bird dart.</p>

<p>The harpoon is a long piece of wood
pointed with bone or iron. It is fastened
into a handle of wood called a throwing-stick.
A cord of seal hide is attached to it at the
other end. You should see our stout little
Etu riding the waves in his kayak, and balancing
the throwing-stick on his shoulder to send
the harpoon flying straight to the mark. But
suppose the harpoon lodges fast in the seal's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
body; if the hunter still holds the other end
of the cord attached to it, the creature in his
fury may make such plunges as to drag the
boat and all down under the water and destroy
them. Something else must be invented.
This was the buoy or float. So it was that
Etu had to make a buoy to complete his
hunting outfit.</p>

<p>He took the skin of a young seal, from
which his mother had scraped off all the hairs,
and tied up the holes made by the head and
legs. Through a small tube fastened in the
skin he could blow up his queerly shaped
buoy to its fullest size.</p>

<p>Now the float was completed. Do you
understand what help it would give? If the
float is attached to the other end of the line
when the harpoon is thrown, the hunter can
let everything go. He does not need to have
any part fastened to the boat. For the float
cannot sink, and will show him where to follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the game, and where to throw next; yet he
is himself in no danger of being pulled after
the animal.</p>

<p>Even now Etu would not be safe to go
hunting in rough waters. He must have a
special coat prepared. This, again, was his
mother's work. The skin of the seal was
used after all the hair was removed. The
jacket was made to fit closely over his other
garments. It had a hood to be drawn tightly
over his head, long sleeves, and drawing-strings
around the neck and lower edge.</p>

<p>When Etu gets into his boat he must fit
his jacket around the hoop of the sitting-hole,
and draw the cord tightly. And now he
seems a part of the boat itself. No water can
enter, and although the waves may dash completely
over him he will keep dry, and the
boat will not sink.</p>

<p>No boy could be happier than Etu was
when his outfit was complete. He ran to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
meet his father to tell him the joyful news.
Now he could be looked upon as a man, no
longer a child. He would hereafter be allowed
to take part in the dangers of his
father's life. He was very glad.</p>

<p>This happy, good-natured boy, who disliked
to say a cross word to any one, who would not
fight with other boys, was certainly no coward.
For his heart was set upon war,&mdash;not war
with his fellows, but war with the winds and
waves, and the powerful creatures of sea and
land. He was ready for battle. Time would
show that courage was not wanting when he
came face to face with danger.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>THE SEAL HUNT.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was about this time that Etu's father
bored holes in his son's lips. These holes
were made at each end of the mouth. Ivory
buttons were fitted into them, and now Etu
felt that he was more of a man than ever
before. It was a proud moment when he
looked in the bit of mirror his father had
bought for ten seal hides, and gazed on his
queer ornaments. He thought they were very
beautiful, and then they fitted so well! The
pain of having the holes bored, and the unpleasant
feeling before the flesh healed, were
of little matter to him. It was not worth
thinking about.</p>

<p>It was a terrible winter, and food was scarce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
There was a very small supply of meat on
hand in the village. The first pleasant morning
after Etu's fishing outfit was finished, he
started off for a day's hunt on the ocean.
Very early in the morning he and his father
went out on the rocks to look for the weather
signs. Yes, it would be a clear day; it would
be safe to venture on the waves. The other
men of the village were already out, and soon
all were busy launching their boats. No breakfast
was eaten; they could work better and
shoot straighter if they waited to eat until
they came back.</p>

<p>Each one of the party carefully arranged his
harpoon, spear, and float on the deck of his
boat; then, shoving it into the icy water,
sprang in after it and quickly fitted himself
into the small seat. The sea jacket must be
drawn carefully around the hoop, for, if water
should enter, the boat would soon sink.</p>

<p>As the hunters paddled merrily along, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
waves kept dashing over the decks. But the
men sang and shouted gaily to each other
as though it were the finest sport in the world.
Yet it was a lonely scene about them; we
should even call it fearful. Cakes of ice jostled
against the boats here and there, and far out
in the dim light a floating field of ice could be
seen by the watchful Eskimos. Sometimes
they hunted for the seals on such fields, for
these creatures often gather in herds on the
ice to bask in the sun and to sport together.
But to-day they would search for them in the
ocean itself.</p>

<p>The boats skimmed onward over the waves
till the land lay far behind. Three hours
passed before the seal ground was reached.
Etu paddled steadily and kept up with the
men who had so much more experience than
himself.</p>

<p>As his father watched him from time to
time, he thought, "My boy will be a leader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
for his people when I grow old and weak. I
have never before seen one so young show
such strength."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 347px;">
<img src="images/i075.jpg" width="347" height="500" alt="whale hunting" />
<div class="caption"><p>"WHIZZ! SOUNDS THE HARPOON AS IT SPEEDS FROM ETU'S SHOULDER"</p></div>
</div>

<p>Etu's father was held to be the best huntsman
of the village, and for this very reason was
looked upon as the chief. The Eskimos
share everything in common, but one man in
a settlement is chosen as the leader. He
settles the disputes and gives advice when it
is needed. He directs the hunt and judges
the wrong-doer. When he fails in strength
it is but right that another should be chosen
in his place.</p>

<p>When the seal ground was reached at last,
the men moved away from each other in different
directions; the singing and shouting
stopped as they rested on their paddles and
watched for seals' heads to appear above the
water. Etu's father kept quite near him; he
might be needed to help his son in case he
was successful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten minutes passed, then twenty, thirty,
but the boy did not grow impatient. His
bright eyes watched closely, scanning the
water in all directions. At last he was rewarded,
for look! there is a brown head rising
into view. The seal is easily frightened, and
darts out of sight when he sees the boy in the
boat. But Etu does not move a muscle till
the seal has disappeared. Then he paddles
rapidly toward the spot where the creature
sank out of sight and once more quietly waits,
but this time with harpoon in hand.</p>

<p>Seals are able to stay under water for twenty
minutes at a time. They can close their nostrils
whenever they choose, and they breathe
very slowly at all times. But they must come
to the surface after a time for fresh air. Etu
knows this and watches.</p>

<p>Ah! the water moves again. The prey is
to be seen and is but a short distance away.
Whizz! sounds the harpoon as it speeds from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Etu's shoulder and goes straight to the mark.
Quick as a flash the float is thrown from the
boat, and the coil of rope fastened to it runs
out as the seal drags it along. He throws
himself about in agony, but cannot free himself
from the cruel harpoon lodged in his side.
The water is stained with blood.</p>

<p>Now the float can be seen on the surface of
the waves, now it is dragged below as the seal
dives out of sight; but Etu does not worry.
He must paddle far enough away from the
seal, however, to keep out of danger. For
although it is usually a timid and gentle
creature, yet, when it is attacked, it grows
daring and dangerous.</p>

<p>Etu knows of several hunters whose boats
have been ripped open by seals; they would
have been killed by their angry foes if their
comrades had not come to their rescue. The
boy has listened to stories of such narrow escapes
ever since he was old enough to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
these things. So he is very quick and
watchful. He does not notice that his father
has drawn quite close, and sits, spear in hand,
ready to end the seal's life if his son should
fail.</p>

<p>And now the wounded animal appears again
directly in front of the boat. A good chance
must not be lost, and Etu, seizing his spear,
drives it straight through one of the flippers.
It pierces the seal's lungs, and after
a few gasps the beautiful soft eyes close in
death.</p>

<p>"Well done, my boy," shouted his father.
"You have won the first prize of the day.
You shall treat our friends."</p>

<p>Now it is a custom among these people of
the cold lands that when a seal is killed the
successful hunter at once cuts away a portion
of blubber, and divides it among the rest of
the party. Etu, therefore, pulled the dead
seal close to his boat, drew out the spear and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
harpoon, and coiled the cord attached to it.
After putting these in their proper places on
the deck of the kayak, he cut away the
blubber, and proudly distributed the treat
among the men, who by this time had drawn
near. It was at least noontime, and was the
first food tasted that day. Every one praised
the boy's skill, and then all drew off once
more to their different stations.</p>

<p>Before the afternoon was over, Etu's father
had secured two seals, and two more were
killed by others of the party. It had been a
most successful hunt, although several accidents
had occurred. One of the seals captured
by Etu's father had succeeded in tearing
the float into shreds before he was finally
killed. Another of the hunters was overturned
and almost drowned. This was because the
cord attached to the harpoon had caught in
a strap on the deck as it was running out.
The wounded seal dragged him along as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
plunged, before he had a chance to free his
boat.</p>

<p>Over they went, man and boat, and only
the keel of the kayak could be seen. The
seal, too, was out of sight. Did it see the
man? was it attacking him below the surface
of the water?</p>

<p>Three of the man's companions paddled
rapidly toward the overturned boat. One of
them reached his arm down under the water
and, giving a skilful jerk to the man's arm,
brought him up suddenly on even keel. Another
of the party cut the cord with his spear.
Still a third found the paddle, of which he had
lost hold, and gave it into his hands. Then
all started off in pursuit of the seal as though
nothing had happened.</p>

<p>You must ask Etu to tell you more of the
wonderful doings of that first ocean hunt.
He will never forget even the smallest thing
which happened on that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>It was near night when the party started
homeward, and three good hours of paddling
were before them. At length, however, the
shore came into view. Nearer and nearer it
looked to the tired workers. And yes! there
were the women waiting and watching, ready
for the good news.</p>

<p>Etu was not the first to land, for you remember
he had a seal in tow, and those who
are so burdened cannot travel as quickly over
the water as others who have no extra weight.
He travelled homeward beside his father's still
more heavily laden boat; while both the man
and his son pictured the mother's delight at
Etu's success.</p>

<p>As the boats landed, one by one, the men
jumped out, and started for home with their
weapons. The women would draw up the
boats into safe places. They would also dispose
of the seals. The men's work was done,
and nothing was left for them now except to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
sit around the oil lamp, eat, and tell stories
of the day's adventures. This very night
there would be a seal feast at Etu's home, and
hours would be given up to eating and making
merry.</p>

<small>FEAST AND FUN.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> did not take long for the hunters to
exchange their wet clothing for dry garments.
Then with their wives and children they gathered
in the home of their chief.</p>

<p>"How could the feast be prepared so
quickly?" we ask in surprise. If we could
have been there we should not have wondered
very long.</p>

<p>The people squatted on the floor in a circle.
Etu and his father stood in their midst with
big knives, ready to cut up the seals lying
before them. Hungry as they were, they
must not eat yet. Something important must
be done first.</p>

<p>The Eskimos have many strange beliefs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
They think there is a spirit in everything,&mdash;the
rock, the snow, the wind, the very air has
its spirit. The seal, therefore, has its spirit,
too, and must be treated respectfully.</p>

<p>Etu's father solemnly sprinkled water on
the body, while every one watched him in
silence. It was an offering to the animal's
spirit. He next carefully cut away the skin
and showed the thick layer of blubber beneath.
The eyes of the company sparkled with delight.
Many funny faces were made as each
in turn received a huge chunk of raw blubber.</p>

<p>Please don't shudder at the thought of
eating it. White travellers among the Eskimos
tell us it is really very good, and tastes
much like fresh cream. It is only after it has
been kept for a long time that it begins to
taste rancid and fishy.</p>

<p>After the blubber had been divided among
the company, the bodies of the two seals were
opened, and the blood scooped out. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
seemed truly delicious to the hungry visitors.
The last course of the feast consisted of the
seal's ribs, which were picked until nothing
was left save the bones.</p>

<p>How the people did eat! How they enjoyed
the dainties served to them! There
were many stories told by those who could
stop long enough to talk. Etu was asked,
over and over again, to describe how he killed
his first seal. And each time the movements
of his face, as well as his arms and hands,
seemed to express as much as the words
themselves.</p>

<p>At this strange feast, for which no cooking
was needed, the women were not served first,
as in our own land. It was the men who were
first thought of, and who received the choicest
pieces. But Etu did not forget his mother,
and looked out to see that she was well
served.</p>

<p>When the feast was over at last, all joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
in a song. There were only a few notes, and
these were repeated over and over again; but
the party must have enjoyed it, or they would
not have sung it so many times.</p>

<p>At last the moon shone down upon them,
and Etu's mother hastened to draw the sealskin
curtain. For her people dread the power
of the moon, and do not willingly sit in its
light. It is a wonderful being, and Etu has
been taught that it brings the cold weather
to his people. How is this possible? Why,
as it dwells afar off in the sky, it whittles the
tusk of a walrus. In some wonderful way
the shavings are changed into the snow which
falls in great sheets over the earth.</p>

<p>By this time the party began to think of
going home. They must prepare for another
"sleep," they said, and the people of the
house were soon left to themselves.</p>

<p>Etu does not count time as we do. He
speaks of a "moon" ago, instead of a month.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Yesterday is the period before the last "sleep,"
and the years are counted by the winters. A
fresh notch is cut in the wall of his winter
home when the family leave it for their summer's
travels. That is the only way his
people have to keep account of the passing
time. They do not write or read, except as
they are taught by their white visitors, and
Etu has never seen a book in his life.</p>

<p>The boy's father has shown him how to
make good maps of the coast. They are very
neat, and are measured so exactly that every
island and point of land are correctly marked
for many miles. They are drawn with the
burnt ends of sticks on smooth pieces of driftwood,
but if you ever visit Etu, you can trust
to them in exploring the country.</p>

<p>On the day after the feast the other seals
were divided evenly among all the people in
the village. The successful hunters did not
once dream of keeping them for their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
families. What! have a fine dinner yourself,
while others around you go hungry!
It was not to be thought of. All must share
alike.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>HARD TIMES.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Time</span> passed by. The weather was terribly
cold, even for these people. The hunters
went out on the ocean whenever it was safe to
venture, but the seals and walruses were very
scarce. They had probably gone in search of
warmer waters.</p>

<p>At this very time their winter stores were
all stolen. Whenever there is an extra supply
on hand, it is hidden in a deep hole underground,
so that neither wild animals nor dogs
can reach it. Such a place for stores is called
a <i>cach</i> by our western hunters and trappers.</p>

<p>One night Etu was wakened by a great
noise outside. In a moment the whole household
was aroused. They heard the dogs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
howling and rushing around. There was certainly
a fight of some kind. Etu and his
father were dressed in a moment, as well as
two other men who shared the home.</p>

<p>"Wolves! It is a pack of wolves," cried the
women. "Don't go out and leave us; it is
not safe."</p>

<p>But the men only seized their spears and
moved as quickly as possible down the passageway.
They must go to the aid of the dogs,
who had been left outdoors for the night.
They also thought of their precious stores.
The wolves had probably scented the place and
were then attacked by the dogs.</p>

<p>In a short time the men returned to the
frightened household. They were all safe.
The wolves had fled, but the harm had already
been done. Not a scrap of the precious stores
remained. The dogs had finished what the
wolves left behind them. It was the quarreling
of the dogs themselves over the food that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
had wakened the people. It was plain, however,
that the wolves had been there, because
the dead body of one of them lay close by the
storehouse. The dogs had been more than a
match for them.</p>

<p>There was nothing for Etu and his people
to eat that day. There was scarcely any oil
in the lamps. The women and children tried
to keep warm beneath the piles of furs; the
men went out to search along the shore for
seal holes.</p>

<p>Our brave little Etu looked upon himself
as a man now. So, leading his brightest dog
by a cord, he started out in search of prey.
The dog had a wonderfully keen scent. He
would help in finding the hiding-place of a
seal, if there were one to be found.</p>

<p>You may not know what a queer home the
mother seal makes for her baby. She chooses
a place on the solid ice that is covered with a
deep layer of snow. She scrapes away the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
snow and carries it down through a hole in
the ice into the water below. When her work
is done, she has a dome-shaped house. The
floor is the icy shelf, from which there is a
passageway to the water beneath. There is
a tiny breathing-place in the snowy roof to
which she turns when needing air.</p>

<p>The baby seal is born in this strange home.
He lies here and sleeps most of the time till
he is old enough to take care of himself. His
mother often visits him. She hopes his enemies
will not find him. But the bear, the fox, and
the Eskimo dog, are watching for signs of just
such hiding-places as these. Their scent is
keen and they discover the tiny breathing-holes
when men and boys would pass them by.
This is why Etu took his dog along with
him.</p>

<p>Perhaps you wonder why Etu did not let
Vanya run free. He only wished him to find
a seal hole; the boy would do the hunting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
himself. The dog, if left alone, might succeed
in scaring away the old seal; and Etu wished
to get both the baby and its mother.</p>

<p>The boy tramped for many hours. Remember,
he had no breakfast this morning,
yet he went with a bright face and a stout
heart. When night came, Etu was still brave
and cheerful, although he had met with no
success. He went home and found the men
just returning. They also had failed.</p>

<p>They could expect no supper, nor fire to
warm them, after the long day's tramp in the
bitter cold, but they must not show sadness;
they must keep up stout hearts for the sake
of the women and children.</p>

<p>After all, there was a surprise waiting for
Etu. His mother had used the last bit of
oil in thawing a little snow to give the
household some water to drink. And, besides
this, there was a scrap of seal hide for each
one to chew. Tough as it was, it was received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
as though it were the greatest dainty in the
world.</p>

<p>After this meal, if it could be called one,
Etu crept into bed, and was soon sound asleep.
Morning came, and our little cousin started
out once more in search of food. But he had
no better success than the day before. When
he got home at night there was good news
awaiting him, although it did not bring any
supper.</p>

<p>His father had found a seal-hole, and had
said to the other men, "I will not leave my
place till I can bring food for my hungry
people." They left him, and went back to
the village to tell his waiting household. His
good wife at once got a heavy fur robe, and
sent it back to her patient husband. He
could wrap it about his feet, as he sat watching
in the cold.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be only a short time
before he would hear the mother seal blowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
at the hole below. But, again, hours
might pass before she would come back to
nurse her baby. Yet the man must watch and
be ready to pierce the breathing-hole with his
long spear at any moment,&mdash;it was his only
chance of killing the mother.</p>

<p>The long hours of the night passed; the
morning, too, was gone, when, suddenly, the
quick ears of the hunter heard the welcome
sound. And now, a second blow! the seal's
head must be close to the hole. Like a flash,
down went the waiting spear, and fastened
itself through the nose of the seal. If it had
turned a half-inch in its course, it would have
failed in its work.</p>

<p>There was a violent pull at the spear, as the
seal darted down through the passage from her
icy home to the water below. But the hunter
had a long rope fastened to the spear, and he
let it run out quickly. Then, brushing away
the snowy roof, he jumped down on the floor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of the "igloo." With two or three strong
pulls he brought up the struggling seal, and
quickly ended her life. It was an easy matter
to dispose of the frightened baby.</p>

<p>What a prize he had gained! He did not
think of his frost-bitten nose, nor of his empty
stomach. He only pictured the joy of the
waiting people when he should reach home.</p>

<p>When the hard-earned supper was set
before them, you cannot guess what was
the greatest dainty of all. It was the milk
inside the baby seal's stomach! It was sweet
and delicate in its taste, and was much like
the milk from a green cocoanut.</p>

<p>There were many other hard times before
that winter was over, but Etu did his part
bravely, and no one died of want.</p>

<p>One day the boy hunted a seal bear-fashion,
and was successful, too. He had learned
many lessons from this wise creature, and he
did not forget them. The polar bear, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
strong and fierce, is also very cunning. If
he discovers a dark spot far away on the ice,
he seems to say to himself, "Ah! there is a
seal asleep. I will deceive him, and catch him
for my dinner." So he creeps, or, rather,
hitches along, with his fore feet curled beneath
him. Nearer and nearer he draws to his prey.
And now the sleeping seal awakes. Is there
danger? But the bear at once stops moving,
and makes a low, strange sound. It
is different from his usual voice. The seal
listens, and is charmed. He turns his head
from side to side, and then is quite still once
more. The bear creeps nearer now; once
more the seal starts, but is again charmed
by the strange sound. Suddenly he is caught
in those powerful claws, and the long, sharp
teeth fasten themselves in his body. In a
moment it is all over with the poor seal.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 349px;">
<img src="images/i099.jpg" width="349" height="500" alt="boy sneaking up on resting seal" />
<div class="caption">"ETU STOPPED MOVING AND LAY QUITE STILL"</div>
</div>

<p>This is one of the lessons Etu learned from
Ninoo, the bear. He followed his teacher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
well when one day he, too, saw a dark spot
on the shore, quite a distance away. Holding
his spear beneath him, he crouched down on
the snow, and jerked himself along. For
some time the seal was not aroused. Then,
opening his eyes, he must have thought: "Is
that a brother seal over there? His coat is
like mine." Still he watched, for a seal is
easily frightened. Etu stopped moving and
lay quite still.</p>

<p>"No, there is no danger," thought the seal;
and he closed his eyes again.</p>

<p>Once more Etu began to move, and drew
quite near before the seal stirred again. But
now the creature seemed to question himself
once more.</p>

<p>"Is it a friend, or is it one of my terrible
enemies?"</p>

<p>He was about to dart away when Etu began
to make a low, strange sound. You would
have thought it was the bear himself, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
imitated so well. The seal seemed pleased,
and did not stir again.</p>

<p>Before another five minutes the young
hunter had killed his victim. He hurried
homeward with the heavy burden flung over
his broad shoulders. You can imagine how
proud his mother felt when he appeared in
the doorway of the house and showed his
prize of the morning.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>AN ESKIMO CHRISTMAS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> long after this Etu's people celebrated
a festival. It was about Christmas time, but
the boy had never heard of our own great
holiday. Yet his own Christmas always means
very much to him.</p>

<p>All the people of the village met together
on a certain evening in Etu's home. The
medicine-man was there, and made a sort of
prayer. He prayed that all might go well
with the people during the coming year.
This medicine-man is the priest as well as
the doctor among the Eskimos. After the
prayer there was a feast. The hunters had
done their best, and had managed to get a
good supply of seal meat on hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day after the feast, men, women,
and children gathered together in a circle in
the open air. A vessel of water had been
placed in their midst. Each one brought a
piece of meat with him. No one spoke while
it was being eaten, but each thought of his
good spirit, and wished for good things.
Then each in turn took a drink of water
from the vessel. As he did so he spoke,
telling when and where he was born.</p>

<p>When this ceremony was over, all threw
presents to each other. They believed they
would receive good things from the good
spirits if they were generous at this time.</p>

<p>Soon after this festival came New Year's.
This, too, was a strange celebration.</p>

<p>Two men, one of them dressed as a woman,
went from hut to hut blowing out the flame
in each lamp. It must be lighted from a
fresh fire.</p>

<p>The people believe there is a new sun in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the heavens at the beginning of each new
year. They think they ought to picture this
great change in their own homes.</p>

<p>The year was a moon old, as Etu would
say, when one day he was out hunting for seal-holes
with his father. They brought a pack
of dogs along with them. These had just
been loosened for a run when they darted off
as though they had found a fresh scent. They
rushed toward a great bank of snow on the
side of a high rock.</p>

<p>Surely it was no seal-hole they had discovered.
The small opening on the surface
of the snow showed that it was the breathing-place
of a polar bear. The mother bear eats
vast quantities of food at the beginning of
winter; then she seeks a sheltered spot at the
foot of some rock, and begins her long rest.
The snow falls in great drifts over her. This
makes a warm, close house. Does it seem as
though she must die for want of air? There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
is no danger of this, for the breath from her
great body thaws enough snow around her to
form a small room. It also makes a sort of
chimney through the snow, to the air above.</p>

<p>The baby bear is born in this house of
snow, and there he stays with his mother till
old enough to hunt for himself.</p>

<p>It was the home of a mother bear, then,
that the dogs had discovered. They were
wildly excited, for Eskimo dogs are no cowards.
They love a bear hunt hugely. They
rushed upon the opening and quickly pushed
away the snow. Etu and his father stood on
the watch for the mother bear and her cub to
appear. They were as much excited as the
dogs, but stood with spears in hand, perfectly
still.</p>

<p>Look out now! for here they come. What
a tiny little thing the baby bear is! It is like
a little puppy. It would be easy to end its
life, but Etu knows that would not be safe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
It would make the mother a hundred times
more dangerous.</p>

<p>The great creature looks now in one direction,
now in another. It would not be hard
for her to escape; but she will not leave her
cub. So she rushes madly toward Etu's
father. The dogs jump around her, biting at
her heels. She does not seem even to notice
them. Look at the long sharp teeth as she
opens her mouth for a spring upon the man.
One blow of her paws would knock him senseless.
But he does not fear. He jumps to
one side and dodges the blow. At the same
time, he strikes at her throat with his long
spear.</p>

<p>The blood gushes forth and she staggers.
However, she shakes herself together with a
great effort and rises on her hind legs to strike
again. The pack of dogs surround her and
keep biting at her legs, but the man would not
be able to escape if Etu did not suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
come up behind. He plunges his own spear far
into her side. She gives one fearful groan and
falls to the ground. No hunter will ever be
troubled by her again.</p>

<p>The poor little cub runs to its mother's
side, giving piteous cries. But no one is left
now to pity and love it, so its life is mercifully
and quickly ended. The men and dogs are
soon on their homeward way. They must get
sledges and go back quickly for the bodies of the
two bears. Suppose that while they were gone
another party of Eskimos should come along,
need they fear their prey would be stolen?
The thought does not enter their heads, for
such a thing has never been known to happen
among their people. They are honest in all
ways, and would not touch that which they
believe to be another's.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>SUMMER TRAVELS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> long winter was over at last, and Etu's
people got ready to leave their underground
homes. They would spend the first spring
days farther up the coast, and closer still to
the water's side; for there they could watch
the seal-holes more easily.</p>

<p>The household goods were packed on the
sledges, and Etu said good-bye to his winter
home for four months. The men walked
along, guiding the dogs, while the women and
children rode in the sledges. They travelled
nearly all day before they came to a place
where they wished to settle. But the weather
was even now bitterly cold. The snow still
covered the earth, and the water along the
shore was a mass of broken ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/i111.jpg" width="345" height="500" alt="buidling an igloo" />
<div class="caption">"THE BLOCKS OF SNOW WERE HANDED TO THEM"</div>
</div>

<p>Where were these people to be sheltered
when night came on? The question could be
easily answered. They would build homes for
themselves in an hour or two. The sheets of
snow around them were quite solid, and the
boys and men began to saw the snow into
thick blocks. The walls and roofs of the
houses should be built of these.</p>

<p>Two men stood in the centre of each cleared
space: the blocks of snow were handed to
them. These were laid on the ground, side
by side, in a circle as large as they wished the
house to be. The foundation was quickly
made. Then another row of snow blocks was
laid above the first, but drawn in toward the
centre a very little. Then came a third row,
and so on, till at last there was just space
enough at the top for one block of snow to
fill it in completely. The new house looked
like a great snow beehive.</p>

<p>But the two builders were shut up inside!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
One of the men on the outside cut a block of
snow out of the wall of the house. This made
a doorway through which people could go and
come. It could be closed afterward, when the
inmates desired, by filling it again with a snow
door.</p>

<p>The builders now took loose snow and
sifted it into the cracks and crevices to make
the house quite close and tight.</p>

<p>After this, the floor must be trodden down
smooth, and then the women could enter to
set up housekeeping. A bed of snow was
quickly made, over which the fur rugs were
thrown. Next, a stand of snow was shaped,
and the lamp set up in its place. The oil was
soon burning brightly, and snow was melted to
furnish drinking-water. In half an hour more
our cousin Etu was eating supper as comfortably
as he could wish. Not long after, he
was sound asleep on his snow bedstead,
without a single dream of cold or trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>After a few weeks of seal hunting, Etu
noticed that the birds were returning. There
were great numbers of them,&mdash;wild ducks,
geese, and sea-birds of many kinds.</p>

<p>The ice began to disappear, and it was great
sport to paddle his boat over to the islands
near the shore, and shoot a bagful of birds
for dinner. But sometimes he stayed in his
boat, and, moving slowly along the shore,
would throw his bird-dart at ducks as they
flew by. His aim was straight and true, and
he was almost sure to be successful.</p>

<p>Spring changed suddenly into summer, and
now the snow house must be left, for Etu
and his people were ready to move again.
Besides, the walls of the house grew soft, and
would soon melt away.</p>

<p>Where would Etu travel next? you ask.
He would answer:</p>

<p>"Not far from here there is a broad river
where great numbers of salmon live during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
warm weather. It is great sport catching the
fish. Now we can have so much rich food
that we can all grow fat."</p>

<p>Once more the dogs were harnessed, and
the spring camping-ground was left behind,
as the Eskimo party journeyed southward.
When the river was reached, new homes must
be made ready. But what material would be
used now? There were no trees to furnish
wood, for the forests were still hundreds of
miles south of them, and snow at this time
of the year was out of the question.</p>

<p>But Etu's people were well prepared, for
they took their supply of skins, and quickly
made tents out of them. It was still so cold
that a double row of skins must be used to
keep out the sharp winds.</p>

<p>And now they were ready for the happiest
part of the whole year. They need not fear
hunger for a long time to come. Plenty of
fish in the river, plenty of birds in the air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
birds' eggs, which the bright eyes of the boys
and girls would discover; and, besides all
these dainties, they would get stores of reindeer
meat.</p>

<p>"How could any one be any happier than
I?" thought Etu, and he smiled a broad
smile, making a funny face to express his
joy.</p>

<p>In another country of the world as far north
as Etu lives, the Laplander has herds of tame
reindeer. They are driven as Etu drives his
dogs. They give sweet milk, too.</p>

<p>Etu has never heard of these people, but he
has been told that there is a place in his own
country where his kind American friends have
brought some of these tame reindeer from
Lapland. Great care is taken of them, so
they will grow and get used to their new
home. It will be a fine thing for Etu's
people to have these tame reindeer and be
able to get fresh milk during the long winter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
as well as tame animals that will supply them
with food when they are in danger of starving.</p>

<p>But Etu busies himself now with setting
traps for the wild reindeer which begin to
appear in the country as summer opens.
They have spent the winter in the forests
far away, but as the heat of the sun begins
to melt the snow, they travel toward the
shores of the ocean.</p>

<p>Here the baby reindeer are born. They
are tiny, weak little creatures at first; but they
grow fast, and in a few days are able to take
care of themselves, and get their own food.</p>

<p>The reindeer have a wonderfully keen sense
of smell. Even when the ground is covered
with a deep layer of snow, they seem able to
tell where the lichens and mosses are living
beneath it. No one has ever seen a reindeer
make a mistake in this matter. When he
begins to paw away the snow with his broad,
stout hoofs, you may be sure he has discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
a good dinner for himself. The lichens
are tender and white, and taste somewhat like
wheat bran. It is no wonder the reindeer
grows fat on this plentiful food.</p>

<p>Etu hunts the reindeer in several different
ways. Sometimes when he is out on the
watch for them he hears a great clattering.
It may be a long way off, and he cannot see
a living thing, yet he knows what that sound
means. It is the hoofs of the reindeer as they
come pounding along.</p>

<p>He lies down and keeps very still. He
watches closely, however, to see if the reindeer
are coming in his direction. If he finds this
to be so, he keeps in the same position and
waits till they have passed by him and are
headed for the shore.</p>

<p>Then he jumps up suddenly, and chases
them with fury. They get confused, and rush
onward in disorder. On he follows till they
reach the water's side, where they plunge madly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
in. They are good swimmers, but are so
frightened that Etu is easily able to secure at
least one of them.</p>

<p>Sometimes our Eskimo cousin goes a long
way over the plains, and with his father's help
digs a deep pit in the earth. They cover it
over with brushwood. If a herd of reindeer
should travel in this direction, some of them
would fall into the pit and break their slender
legs. It would be an easy matter then to
come and get them.</p>

<p>But there is another way that Etu likes best
of all. Soon after he came to his summer
home he hunted about over the country till
he had chosen a spot where the reindeer were
likely to come. Here he built a sort of fort,
or wall, out of stones. He could hide behind
this wall, and watch for his game without their
being able to see him. He spent many days
of the summer in this place with one of his
boy friends. They would sit there talking, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
playing some quiet game, but their bows and
arrows were always ready; and their eyes ever
on the lookout for the reindeer who might
come that way at any moment.</p>

<p>Many times, of course, they met with no
success; but many times, too, they took a
herd by surprise, and were able to carry home
a goodly feast to their friends and relatives.</p>

<p>Reindeer meat is tender and sweet, the
marrow and tongue being the parts best liked
by Etu's people. But the most delicious food
Etu ever puts into his mouth is the contents
of a reindeer's stomach! We must not be
shocked at this, though it does seem a queer
thing to eat, doesn't it? The reason Etu
likes it so well is probably this: the food of
the reindeer is moss; when it has entered his
stomach it has a slightly acid taste, so it gives
a relish the people cannot often get. Besides,
it belongs to the vegetable kingdom, and Etu's
people, we know, do not have the pleasure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
eating corn, potatoes, and other delicious fruits
of the earth, so commonly used by us that we
hardly appreciate them.</p>

<p>It was after one of these long days on the
plains that Etu came home feeling quite ill.
His head ached; his eyes were bloodshot;
his hands and face burned like fire.</p>

<p>His loving mother was quite worried. She
put her son to bed at once, and sent for the
medicine-man. She got a present of deer skins
ready to give him as soon as the great person
should appear.</p>

<p>After he had accepted the deer skins the
doctor put on a horrible black mask; then
he began to move about the tent, waving his
arms from side to side, and repeating a charm.
Do you understand what he was trying to do?
He thought a bad spirit had got hold of Etu;
he believed the hideous mask and the charm
of certain words would drive it out.</p>

<p>After awhile he went away, and Etu was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
alone again with his own people. His fever
lasted for several days, but at length it left
him, and he grew well and strong once more.
He believed the great medicine-man had
healed him; but we think Mother Nature
worked her own cure through rest in his
own warm bed. The poor boy was tired out,
and had caught a hard cold watching on the
plains.</p>

<p>As soon as he was strong his father said:
"The trading season has come, for it is already
two moons since we made our camp.
We must journey southward to the great river.
We shall see our friends from the western
coast; they must have already started to meet
us. Let us get our furs, seal oil, and walrus
tusks together to sell to them, for, no doubt,
they will have many things to give us in exchange.
We greatly need some copper kettles
and tobacco. Oh, yes, let us get ready as
soon as possible."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Etu was delighted to hear these words.
Now would come the merriest time. He
would have a long journey, and he dearly
liked a change. But that was not all. He
would see new people, and hear of new things;
he would have a chance to trade, and that
would be great sport in itself.</p>

<p>Besides all these things, he knew his people
would spend at least ten days with their friends
from the west; and there would be much
dancing and singing and story-telling, both
day and night. Hurrah, then, for this summer
journey!</p>

<p>You may be sure Etu did his best in packing
and making ready. In another twenty-four
hours there was no sign left of this
Eskimo village. The dogs, the sledges, and
the people were all gone. Nothing was left
except a few articles used in housekeeping,
and these were buried in an underground
storehouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>If you wish to hear more about Etu, and of
his yearly visit south; if you care to hear
about the big whale he helped to kill last
winter, and of his adventure with a walrus,
you must write and ask him about these
things.</p>

<p>And yet, after all, I fear he could not read
the letter. You would better go and visit
him. It is well worth the journey, for then
you can see for yourself how a boy can be
cheerful and happy and loving, even though
he lives in the dreariest part of the whole
world.</p>

ask for, but do not always get. Rosamond and Rosalind
are the hero and heroine of many happy adventures
in town and on their grandfather's farm; and the happy
listeners to their story will unconsciously absorb a vast
amount of interesting knowledge of birds, animals, and
flowers. The book will be a boon to tired mothers, and
a delight to wide-awake children.</p>

<p>James Otis, who has delighted the juvenile public
with so many popular stories, has written the story of
the rise of the bootblack Larry. Larry is not only
capable of holding his own and coming out with flying
colors in the amusing adventures wherein he befriends
the family of good Deacon Doak; he also has the
signal ability to know what he wants and to understand
that hard work is necessary to win.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxendale's charming story, though written
primarily for children, will find a warm welcome from
all those who love animals. It is a true story of a
deeply loved pet and companion of the author's for
thirteen years; and it cannot fail to inspire in the hearts
of all the young people fortunate enough to hear it that
affection and sympathy for domestic animals so essential
in the moulding of character.</p>

<p>It is delightfully human in its interest, and contains,
besides the main theme of a rarely beautiful dog life,
character sketches which show keen observation and
that high order of talent requisite in writing for children,
and exemplified in "Black Beauty" and "Beautiful
Joe," of a place beside which, the publishers believe,
"Yours with All My Heart" will be found worthy.</p>

<p>"One might almost as well offer June roses with the

little gathering of verse, which announces itself, like
them, by its deliciousness. Yet as Mrs. Morrison's
charming volume has long been a delight to me, I am
only too happy to link my name with its new and enriched

it is to me the most bewitching book of songs for little

<p class='adtitle4'><span class='booktitle'>The Little Colonel.</span> (Trade Mark.)</p>

<p>The scene of this story is laid in Kentucky. Its
heroine is a small girl, who is known as the Little
Colonel, on account of her fancied resemblance to an
old-school Southern gentleman, whose fine estate and
old family are famous in the region. This old Colonel
proves to be the grandfather of the child.</p>


<p class='adtitle3'>The Giant Scissors.</p>

<p>This is the story of Joyce and of her adventures in
France,&mdash;the wonderful house with the gate of The
Giant Scissors, Jules, her little playmate, Sister Denisa,
the cruel Brossard, and her dear Aunt Kate. Joyce is
a great friend of the Little Colonel, and in later volumes
shares with her the delightful experiences of the "House
Party" and the "Holidays."</p>


<p class='adtitle3'>Two Little Knights of Kentucky,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Who Were the Little Colonel's Neighbors</span>.</p>

<p>In this volume the Little Colonel returns to us like an
old friend, but with added grace and charm. She is
not, however, the central figure of the story, that place
being taken by the "two little knights."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Ad_2c" id="Page_Ad_2c">[C-2]</a></span></p>


<p class='adtitle3'>Cicely and Other Stories for Girls.</p>

<p>The readers of Mrs. Johnston's charming juveniles

appeal to all boys and most girls.</p>


<p class='adtitle3'>Big Brother.</p>

<p>A story of two boys. The devotion and care of
Steven, himself a small boy, for his baby brother, is the
theme of the simple tale, the pathos and beauty of which
has appealed to so many thousands.</p>


<p class='adtitle3'>Ole Mammy's Torment.</p>

<p>"Ole Mammy's Torment" has been fitly called "a
classic of Southern life." It relates the haps and mishaps
of a small negro lad, and tells how he was led by
love and kindness to a knowledge of the right.</p>


<p class='adtitle3'>The Story of Dago.</p>

<p>In this story Mrs. Johnston relates the story of Dago,
a pet monkey, owned jointly by two brothers. Dago
tells his own story, and the account of his haps and mishaps
is both interesting and amusing.</p>


<p class='adtitle3'>The Quilt That Jack Built.</p>

<p>A pleasant little story of a boy's labor of love, and

Christmas was invented by Betty Sewall, a typical child
of the Puritans, aided by her brother Sam.</p>

<p>The author's motive for this story is well indicated by
a quotation from her introduction, as follows:</p>

<p>"One ride is memorable in the early history of the
American Revolution, the well-known ride of Paul
Revere. Equally deserving of commendation is another
ride,&mdash;untold in verse or story, its records preserved
only in family papers or shadowy legend, the ride of
Anthony Severn was no less historic in its action or
memorable in its consequences."</p>


<p class='adtitle3'>A Loyal Little Maid.</p>

<p>A delightful and interesting story of Revolutionary
days, in which the child heroine, Betsey Schuyler,
renders important services to George Washington.</p>


<p class='adtitle3'>A Little Puritan Rebel.</p>

<p>Like Miss Robinson's successful story of "A Loyal
Little Maid," this is another historical tale of a real girl,
during the time when the gallant Sir Harry Vane was
governor of Massachusetts.</p>


<p class='adtitle3'>A Little Puritan Pioneer.</p>

<p>The scene of this story is laid in the Puritan settlement
at Charlestown. The little girl heroine adds

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
